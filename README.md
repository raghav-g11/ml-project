🩺 Deep Learning-Based Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

# Using Retinal Fundus Images

# 📌 Overview

This project implements a deep learning-powered system to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal fundus images, classifying them into five severity stages. By automating DR detection, the system aims to assist ophthalmologists, reduce screening time, and enable early intervention—especially in resource-limited regions.

# 🎯 Objectives

1 Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automated DR detection.

2 Classify images into five stages of severity.

3 Compare model performance with state-of-the-art DR detection methods.

4 Improve screening accessibility, affordability, and accuracy.

# 🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, h5py, imgaug

Algorithms: CNN, ResNet

Dataset: Publicly available retinal fundus images (~35,000 images)

# ⚙️ Methodology

1 Image Collection – Public DR datasets.

2 Preprocessing – Grayscale conversion, noise removal (median filter), contrast enhancement.

3 Segmentation – Mean Shift Clustering for dense region detection.

4 Feature Extraction – Color histogram, texture, shape features.

5 Training – CNN-based architecture for classification.

6 Classification – Five-stage severity prediction.
